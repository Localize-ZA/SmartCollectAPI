Apple Inc. is planning to open a new headquarters in New York City by 2026. The tech giant's CEO, Tim Cook, announced this expansion during the quarterly earnings call on March 15, 2025. The new facility will employ approximately 5,000 engineers and designers, focusing primarily on artificial intelligence and machine learning research.

The company has already secured a $2.5 billion investment for this project. Microsoft and Google are also expanding their presence in the Northeast region, creating intense competition for top talent. Amazon Web Services announced similar plans last month, indicating a trend toward decentralization in the tech industry.

Dr. Sarah Johnson, a technology analyst at Goldman Sachs, believes this move will significantly impact the job market. "We're seeing unprecedented growth in AI-related positions," she stated in her recent report. The report also mentioned that salaries for AI engineers have increased by 35% over the past year.

Location details: The headquarters will be situated at 123 Innovation Drive, Manhattan, NY 10001. Contact information includes phone number (555) 123-4567 and email address info@apple-ny.com for media inquiries.
