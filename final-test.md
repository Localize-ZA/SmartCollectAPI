# Final Test Document

This is the **final test** for our Smart Collect API vector storage fix.

## What We Fixed

1. Enhanced MIME detection for markdown files
2. Configured OSS service providers 
3. Fixed stream handling in document pipeline
4. Resolved pgvector parameter serialization

## Expected Result

This document should now:
- Be detected as `text/markdown` 
- Process through the complete pipeline
- Generate vector embeddings
- Save successfully to PostgreSQL with pgvector
- Show as "done" status instead of "failed"

```javascript
console.log("Vector storage is working!");
```

Let's see if our fixes worked! ðŸš€
