# FINAL PIPELINE TEST 

## ✅ MIME Type Detection Test
This `.md` file should be detected as `text/markdown` instead of `application/octet-stream`.

## ✅ Text Extraction Test  
The parser should extract this content:
- **Headers** with # symbols
- **Bold** and *italic* formatting
- Lists and bullet points
- `Inline code` snippets

```javascript
// Code blocks should be included in extracted text
function testComplete() {
    return "Pipeline working!";
}
```

## ✅ Entity Extraction Test
Entities like **OpenAI**, **Microsoft Azure**, and **Google Cloud** should be processed by the SimpleEntityExtractionService.

## ✅ Embedding Generation Test
The SimpleEmbeddingService should generate vector embeddings for semantic search capabilities.

## Expected Final Status: `done` ✅

This document should complete the full processing pipeline successfully and move from `staging` to `done` status!
